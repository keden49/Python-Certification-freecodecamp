        "# PROJECT OVERVIEW\n",
        "This is a modified version of the movie calculator as part of the freecodecamp curriculum.\n",
        "\n",
        "# MAIN UPDATES\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Refactoring into a Reusable Function\n",
        "The most significant change is the transition from a script with hardcoded variables to a defined function.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Original: The code in Movie_calculator.ipynb uses fixed variables (e.g., age = 18) and executes line-by-line with print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Update: Test_file.ipynb encapsulates this logic into a function named movie_calculator that accepts five parameters (age, show_time, seat_type, is_member, and is_weekend).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Return Value: Instead of just printing results, the new function returns a list of strings (results), allowing the caller to decide how to display or store the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Dynamic Input and Validation Loop\n",
        "- The updated file introduces a user-facing interface to gather information dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Questionnaire: It uses a list called QUESTIONS and a for loop to iterate through all necessary inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Input Validation: Added while True loops and .isdigit() checks to ensure the user provides valid data (like integers for age) before moving to the next question.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. \"Short-Circuit\" Logic for Underage Users\n",
        "The test file includes a specialized \"early exit\" for users who are too young, which was not present in the original script.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The is_eligible Flag: The code now checks the user's age immediately. If the user is 17 or younger, it sets an is_eligible flag to False and breaks the loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Efficiency: This prevents the program from wasting time asking about seat types or membership status if the user is already disqualified based on age.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Corrected Boolean Parsing\n",
        "- The updated code addresses a common Python pitfall regarding string-to-boolean conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Bug: The comments in Test_file.ipynb note that using bool(\"False\") would incorrectly return True.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Fix: The updated logic uses a direct comparison, is_member = (is_member_str == 'True'), to ensure the boolean value accurately reflects the user's input.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Structured Test Scenarios\n",
        "\n",
        "- While the original file only showed one execution path, Test_file.ipynb contains four distinct test blocks to verify different logical conditions.\n",
